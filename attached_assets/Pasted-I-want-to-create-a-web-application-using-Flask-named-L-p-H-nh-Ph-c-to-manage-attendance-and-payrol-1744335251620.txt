I want to create a web application using Flask, named Lớp Hạnh Phúc, to manage attendance and payroll for a special education classroom.
The UI must be in Vietnamese, simple, mobile-friendly, and responsive.
Code should be modular and structured across the following files:
app.py, main.py, auth.py, attendance.py, models.py, gsheet.py, reports.py, with templates/ and static/ folders.
The database uses SQLite, and all times follow the Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh timezone.

🔐 1. Login
Two user roles:

Admin: logs in using email and password
→ Default admin: lophoanhaphanhphuc@gmail.com, password: 4446

Teachers: login only with their email (no password)

If a teacher logs in for the first time and their email matches a Teacher record, create a new User and link it

The login page should only show the login form, no introduction or instructions

👨‍🏫 2. Manage Teachers and Students
Admin can add, edit, delete teachers and students

Preloaded student list:

css

Hào, An Nhiên, Thiên Kim, Thiên An, Hải Nguyên, Tín, Kiệt, Duy Anh,
Ái Vy, Hoàng Khôi, Ken, Khải, Phát, Nghi
Students can have photos uploaded for face recognition

Teachers are added by admin via name and email

📆 3. Attendance & Payroll
A. Teacher Attendance
Teachers clock in based on shifts:

Morning: 06:00 – 12:00

Afternoon: 12:00 – 16:45

1-on-1: 16:45 – 21:00 (3 types: 1h, 1.5h, 2h)

Buttons for each shift only appear if the current time falls within the valid hours

Each shift can only be marked once per day per teacher

Sundays are not allowed for attendance or payroll

B. Student Attendance
Both teachers and admins can mark student attendance

Students can only be marked once per day

Student attendance is shown directly on the teacher homepage

Students are displayed with their photo:

If present → green with "Có mặt"

If absent → red with "Chưa có mặt"

🏠 4. Teacher Homepage
The teacher’s homepage should contain:

Self-attendance section (top), with shift buttons shown only during allowed hours

Student attendance section directly below, without navigating to another page

Teaching calendar:

Monthly calendar view with marked days

Each day shows which shift was taught

Summary of:

Total morning shifts

Total afternoon shifts

Total 1-on-1 shifts

Total hours worked

Sundays should be excluded

🧑‍💼 5. Admin Dashboard
Shows:

Number of students who are present today

Number of teachers who are currently working (based on shift), and their names

Admin can:

Delete incorrect attendance (students or teachers)

View monthly report:

All shifts taught

Total shifts, hours per teacher

Breakdown by date and type of shift

Sundays are excluded

🔄 6. Google Sheets Sync
Use a fixed Google Sheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rvI7Tftvp5fFnL79IJn6FxOstDulBOyrRQJm7DePP_s/edit
Each time someone is marked present (student or teacher), a row is added to the sheet with:

Date, Time, Name, Status (Có mặt), Shift, Marked by

When attendance is deleted in the app, the corresponding row in Google Sheet must be deleted as well

Use gspread + oauth2client, and authenticate using a service account JSON stored in an environment variable:

nginx

⚙️ 7. Technical Requirements
Flask + SQLAlchemy + SQLite

Flask-Login for authentication and role-based access

Use pytz to localize all time to Vietnam

Must be fully responsive on mobile

Codebase must be clean and modular:

auth.py, attendance.py, app.py, main.py, reports.py, models.py, gsheet.py, templates/, static/

✅ Please generate a full Flask project structure with all the features above implemented. Make sure it's functional, clean, and easy to expand later.
